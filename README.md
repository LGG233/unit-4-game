# Crystal Collector!

Crystal Collector is a game where players score points by clicking on crystals. To win the game, their total score must match a number provided at the start of the game.

The point values for each crystal are hidden, so the player must calculate the value of each crystal based on its effect on their total score. The only way to win is to match exactly the number provided: having a lower score requires the player to continue clicking crystals, and a higher score – even by a single point – means they lose the game. 

Wins and losses are tracked as long as the player keeps the game window open.

# Why the Project Is Useful 
The assignment required us to use both jQuery and plain-vanilla JavaScript to build game functionality. 

I created eight separate functions to generate random numbers, assign values to user clicks, and track player scores and progress. It was a fun project to build and refine, because it called for very specific elements (generating random numbers, assigning click values, etc.) while leaving room for design and operational creativity. The game is dynamic, generating new values each time it is run, and was a challenging exercise.

# How to Play
<ul>The object of the game is to match your score with the Points to Match provided at the start of each game.</ul>
<ul>Clicking on each of the four crystals adds that crystal's value to your score. The values of the crystals are hidden, so you must determine their value to calculate a winning combination that gets you to the desired score.</ul>
<ul>Your score must equal Points to Match exactly in order to win. Going over - even by a single point - is recorded as a loss.</ul>
<ul>The game restarts automatically each time a win or a loss is recorded, generating new values for each crystal and a new number to match.</ul>
<ul>Good luck!</ul>
